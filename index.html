<h6> Hold on<h6>
 <p><p><h3> Loving and fighting, accusing, denying<h3><br>
</h3>I can't imagine a world with you gone<h3><br>
</h3>The joy and the chaos, the demons we're made of<h3><br>
</h3>I'd be so lost if you left me alone<h3><br>
</h3>You locked yourself in the bathroom<h3><br>
</h3>Lying on the floor when I break through<h3><br>
</h3>I pull you in to feel your heartbeat<h3><br>
</h3>Can you hear me screaming? Please don't leave me<h3><br>
 
<p><p><h3>Hold on, I still want you<h3><br>
</h3>Come back, I still need you<h3><br>
</h3>Let me take your hand, I'll make it right<h3><br>
</h3>I swear to love you all my life<h3><br>
 
 <p><p><h3>Hold on, I still need you<h3><br>
</h3>Long endless highway, you're silent beside me<h3><br>
</h3>Driving a nightmare I can't escape from<h3><br>
</h3>Helplessly praying, the light isn't fading<h3><br>
</h3>Hiding the shock and the chill in my bones<h3><br>
</h3>They took you away on a table<h3><br>
</h3>I pace back and forth as you lay still<h3><br>
</h3>They pull you in to feel your heartbeat<h3><br>
</h3>Can you hear me screaming? Please don't leave me<h3><br>
 
 <p><p><h3>Hold on, I still want you<h3><br>
</h3>Come back, I still need you<h3><br>
</h3>Let me take your hand, I'll make it right<h3><br>
</h3>I swear to love you all my life<h3><br>
 
 <p><p><h3>Hold on, I still need you<h3><br>
</h3>I don't wanna let go<h3><br>
</h3>I know I'm not that strong<h3><br>
</h3>I just wanna hear you<h3><br>
</h3>Saying, "Baby, let's go home"<h3><br>
</h3>Let's go home<h3><br>
</h3>Yeah, I just wanna take you home<h3><br>
</h3>Hold on, I still want you<h3><br>
</h3>Come back, I still need you<h3><br>
